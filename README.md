# Welcome to the repository of Freeway traffic model for Introduction to Complex Systems university course 


## What is this?

This is a Python implementation of a cellular automaton for traffic modeling described in the paper attached. 
This implementation extends the model with a rubbernecking scenario (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubbernecking) and a possibility of a sudden and temporary obstacle on the road (called 'deer' in the code).
## Get started
The project uses python and poetry. Pyenv is recommended.
To set up project run `poetry install & poetry shell` while in the `model` folder.
